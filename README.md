# Introduction

Early detection of cancer is essential in modern healthcare, as timely intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. In the case of breast cancer, quick and accurate diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment and higher survival rates. This project aims to use machine learning to analyze a dataset and develop a model that predicts whether a breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with a tool for prompt and precise diagnostic decisions. This initiative seeks to enhance patient outcomes and reduce the burden of cancer on individuals and healthcare systems.

## Dataset

This report pertains to a dataset taken from Kaggle encompassing details regarding breast cancer diagnoses. The dataset comprises 33 columns and 569 rows, where each row corresponds to a patient and each column delineates distinct features of the patient's diagnosis.

- **First column**: A unique identifier for each patient.  
- **Second column**: Indicates whether the patient's diagnosis was malignant (M) or benign (B).  
- **Subsequent columns**: Include numerical data regarding diverse physical attributes of the tumor, derived from digital mammography images. These attributes include:
    - Radius mean
    - Texture mean
    - Perimeter mean
    - Area mean
    - Smoothness mean
    - Compactness mean
    - Concavity mean
    - Concave points mean
    - ...and others.

## Methodology

This study utilizes machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic regression  
- Decision trees  
- Random forests  

The process involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.
2. **Model Training**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Evaluation**: Comparing algorithms using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The selected model will be integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to input tumor characteristics and receive predictions on whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign. This approach aims to create an accurate and user-friendly diagnostic tool for early breast cancer detection.

## Dataset Columns

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **id**: A unique identifier for each patient  
- **diagnosis**: Malignant (M) or benign (B)  
- **radius_mean**: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter  
- **texture_mean**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values  
- **perimeter_mean**: Perimeter of the tumor  
- **area_mean**: Area of the tumor  
- **smoothness_mean**: Local variation in radius lengths  
- **compactness_mean**: Perimeter^2 / area - 1.0  
- **concavity_mean**: Severity of concave portions of the contour  
- **concave points_mean**: Number of concave portions of the contour  
- **symmetry_mean**: Symmetry of tumor  
- **fractal_dimension_mean**: "Coastline approximation" - 1  
- ... (similar columns for "_se" and "_worst" metrics).  
- **Unnamed: 32**: An empty column that can be dropped from the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing

The following steps were taken to preprocess the dataset:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressing any null entries.
